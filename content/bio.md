I am a statistician, genomics researcher, and machine learning engineer. My passion lies in developing data science methods to solve complex problems in biomedical research and public health. Currently I find myself in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, where I am a first-year doctoral student working with [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). I am funded by a [T32 training grant](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/t32-training-grant) from the National Institutes of Health. Previously I studied mathematics at Andrews University, augmenting my experience with endeavors such as building a solar energy system in Madagascar and doing "maths" in Budapest. When not proving theorems or analyzing data I enjoy hiking in the great outdoors, reading classic literature, and playing video games.

I plan to pursue a research career within the medical or healthcare industries. Right now I am open to internship offers!
