I am a third-year PhD student in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, where I am advised by [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). Additionally, I am a member of Minnesota's [Interdisciplinary Biostatistics Training in Genetics and Genomics](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/t32-training-grant) program. My studies and research are funded by a T32 predoctoral fellowship from the National Institutes of Health, as well as internal grants. Previously I completed a BS at Andrews University with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computing, during which time I augmented my experience with endeavors such as building a solar energy system in Madagascar and studying "maths" in Budapest. I am also a [Goldwater Scholar](https://www.andrews.edu/agenda/49499/) and have research experience at Williams College and UCLA's Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics.

When not proving theorems or analyzing data I enjoy hiking in the great outdoors, playing [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/mykmal) (albeit rather poorly), and spending time with my wonderful girlfriend. I also serve as a Student Ambassador for the Division of Biostatistics, so if you are considering our doctoral program please reach out to me!

For additional details please see my short [résumé](/mykmal-resume.pdf) or my comprehensive [curriculum vitae](/mykmal-cv.pdf).
