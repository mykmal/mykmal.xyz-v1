### Professional

I am a third-year PhD student in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). Additionally, I am a member of the university's [Interdisciplinary Biostatistics Training in Genetics and Genomics](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/t32-training-grant) program. My studies and research are funded by a T32 predoctoral fellowship from the National Institutes of Health and by the Jean Roberts Biostatistics Fellowship from my division. Previously I completed a BS at Andrews University with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computing, during which time I augmented my experience with endeavors such as bringing solar power to a remote school in Madagascar and studying "maths" in Budapest. I am also a [Goldwater Scholar](https://www.andrews.edu/agenda/49499/) and have completed internships/REUs at Williams College and UCLA's Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics.

For additional details please see my short [resume](/mykmal-resume.pdf) or my comprehensive [CV](/mykmal-cv.pdf).

### Personal

Right now most of my off-work time is occupied, in one way or another, by Russia's horrific invasion of Ukraine. I was born in Kyiv and still retain close ties to my home country, so this war feels especially painful for me. Please continue to support Ukraine in every way you can. If you are in the Twin Cities area, I encourage you to check out [www.standwithukrainemn.com](https://www.standwithukrainemn.com/) for local events and advocacy opportunities.  
Слава Україні!

For leisure I enjoy [playing chess](https://www.chess.com/member/mykmal) (albeit rather poorly) and spending time in the great outdoors. Both with my wonderful girlfriend, of course. Since the pandemic began I have also embraced a digital nomad lifestyle, never staying in one state for more than several months and often alternating between America's west and east coasts.
