I introduce myself as a statistician, genomics researcher, and machine learning engineer. My passion lies in developing data science methods to solve complex problems in biomedical research and public health. I am especially interested in how genetic variability influences brain function, from childhood neurodevelopmental disorders to aging-related degenerative diseases. By building probabilistic models that integrate genomic sequencing and brain imaging data, I seek to uncover the underlying causes of such conditions. Previously I also researched infectious disease management from the perspective of mathematical epidemiology, and I am still happy to collaborate on related projects.

Currently I find myself in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, where I am a second-year doctoral student working with [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). I am funded by a [T32 training grant](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/t32-training-grant) from the National Institutes of Health. Previously I studied mathematics at Andrews University, augmenting my experience with endeavors such as building a solar energy system in Madagascar and doing "maths" in Budapest. When not proving theorems or analyzing data I enjoy pondering ways to improve STEM education, hiking in the great outdoors, and reading classic literature.
