This summer I will be working as a Human Genetics Intern within the Discovery Genomics Group at [Denali Therapeutics](https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/). More generally I am a third-year PhD student in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). Additionally, I am a member of the university's [Interdisciplinary Biostatistics Training in Genetics and Genomics](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/t32-training-grant) program. My studies and research are funded by a T32 predoctoral fellowship from the National Institutes of Health and by the Jean Roberts Biostatistics Fellowship from my division.

Previously I completed a BS at Andrews University with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computing, during which time I augmented my experience with endeavors such as bringing solar power to a remote school in Madagascar and studying "maths" in Budapest. I am also a [Goldwater Scholar](https://www.andrews.edu/agenda/49499/) and have done undergraduate research internships (REUs) at Williams College and UCLA's Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics.

For additional details please see my short [resume](/mykmal-resume.pdf) or my comprehensive [CV](/mykmal-cv.pdf).

**Right now much of my off-work time is occupied, in one way or another, by Russia's horrific invasion of Ukraine. I was born in Kyiv and still retain close ties to my home country, so this war feels especially painful for me. Please continue to support Ukraine in every way that you can. Слава Україні!**
