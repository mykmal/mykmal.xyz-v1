***Solving complex diseases with statistics + genomics***

I am a second-year PhD student in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, where I am advised by [Wei Pan](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~weip/). Additionally, I am an NIH-funded predoctoral fellow with the [Interdisciplinary Biostatistics Training in Genetics and Genomics](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/t32-training-grant) program. Previously I completed a BS in Mathematics at Andrews University, during which time I augmented my experience with endeavors such as building a solar energy system in Madagascar and studying "maths" in Budapest. I am also a [Goldwater Scholar](https://www.andrews.edu/agenda/49499/) and have research experience at Williams College and UCLA's Institute for Pure & Applied Mathematics. For additional details please see my short [résumé](/mykmal-resume.pdf) or my comprehensive [curriculum vitae](/mykmal-cv.pdf).

My research interests span the many applications of statistics in genetics and molecular biology, but I especially focus on the genetic basis of complex human diseases. By developing probabilistic and computational methods that synthesize genomic information with other omic data sets, I seek to uncover how genetic variability impacts disease pathways. That is, my aim is to go beyond merely finding gene-trait associations: I want to understand how and to what extent genetic mutations cause diseases such as Alzheimer’s and cancer. To this end I am working on causal inference frameworks for functional genomics, for which I draw inspiration from instrumental variables regression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. Before I discovered my passion for statistical genetics, I researched infectious disease management from the perspective of mathematical epidemiology and I am still happy to collaborate on related projects.

When not proving theorems or analyzing data, I enjoy pondering ways to improve STEM education, hiking in the great outdoors, and reading classic literature. I also serve as a Student Ambassador for the University of Minnesota's Division of Biostatistics, so if you are considering our doctoral program please reach out to me!
